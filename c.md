# C

This is a brief introduction to the C programming language.

## About

A programming language is a system of notation for writing code with the intention of creating a computer program. A lot of programming languages exists but only a few are commonly used, one of these being C.

C was created in the seventies and is hence one of the older programming languages. It is despite being old still widely used. We encounter multiple devices daily that are  likely to be relying on a program written in C:

- The vehicle you use to travel
- Electronic locks that protects your workplace or home
- Appliances; washing machines, vending machines, coffee makers
- Electronic communication; network devices, satellites
